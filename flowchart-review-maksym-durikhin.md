# Algorithm overview

## Errors:

1. (a, b == i-th and j-th elem
of Unsorted_array), (i-th elem of Unsorted_array = b
j-th elem of unsorted_array = a)
This cannot be used in the algorithm! A serious error!

2. <Repeat n-1 times> is fluorinated twice - incorrect.

3. The user input acceptance system is poorly described.

4. The algorithm does not match the code, since it does not implement functions, etc.

## Correct:

1. A beautifully designed algorithm
