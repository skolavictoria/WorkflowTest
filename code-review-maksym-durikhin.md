## Clear and well-structured code

The program is organized into separate functions, this increases readability.

It also checks for negative values ​​and prevents the allocation of an invalid array size.

## Sorting implementation

Bubble sort is implemented correctly using a nested loop structure, the elements will swap until they are in ascending order.

### But the are no comments :()
