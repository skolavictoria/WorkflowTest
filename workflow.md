## Workflow for Sorting Algorithms Assignment

1. Create a branch with name dev-<student-name-surname>
2. Git checkout <branch name>
3. Do the task:
   - Read the TASK.md and README.md files carefully to understand the requirements
   - Create a flowchart for the task
   - Rename sorting.c.template to sorting.c
   - Implement all required sorting algorithms in sorting.c
   - Test your implementation using both the pytest tests and manual testing
4. Add, commit, and push to your branch:
   ```
   git add sorting.c
   git commit -m "Implement sorting algorithms"
   git push origin dev-<student-name-surname>
   ```
5. Checkout to branch that was sent to you via the Discord bot
6. create in that branch code-review-<your-name>.md file with the code review
and flowchart-review-<your-name>.md
